# Hi there, I'm Thomas Cyriac! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I tinker with code, occasionally break things, and sometimes even fix them. I'm currently freelancing at Upwork, turning thoughts into code and ideas into reality.

### About Me

- **🎓 Education**: B.Tech in Computer Science from SRM Institute of Science and Technology. That's where I learned that "Hello, World!" is the gateway drug to a lifetime of coding.
- **🛠️ Skills**: I consider myself an engineer who can build just about anything. So far, I've dabbled in AI, DevOps, and Blockchain Technology—think of it as engineering with a side of "future tech."
- **💻 Setup**: I'm rolling with a Dell XPS 15 9520 running NixOS 24.05, because why settle for standard when you can have epic?
- **🤖 Fun Fact**: I used AI to write this README because, let’s face it, I'm too lazy to do it myself. Efficiency at its finest!

### Why "thinktanktom"?

Why "thinktanktom," you ask?  
"ThinkTankTom" isn’t just a random mashup of words; it’s a testament to my love for solving complex puzzles with a dash of creativity. Think of it as the place where big ideas meet practical solutions—kind of like a think tank, but with fewer suits and more code. And "Tom"? Well, that's just there to keep things friendly and to remind everyone that even the most serious problems deserve a bit of a personal touch.
