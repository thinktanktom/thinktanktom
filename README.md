Hello, world! I'm Thomas Cyriac, your friendly neighborhood freelancer currently adding some extra flair to the Upwork universe. When I'm not busy conjuring up digital marvels, I'm reminiscing about my days studying B.Tech Computer Science at SRM Institute of Science and Technology—where I learned that "debugging" is just a fancy term for "fighting with code."

I like to think of myself as an engineer who can build just about anything, though my recent projects in AI, DevOps, and Blockchain Technology have been more like "engineering on steroids" (minus the actual steroids, of course). 

I’m currently operating with a Dell XPS 15 9520, running NixOS 24.05—because, you know, standard operating systems are just too mainstream. 

And here’s a fun fact: I used AI to write this page because, let’s be honest, my laziness is next level. If you want to reach out (or just want to see if I'm as witty in real life), drop me a line at [thinktanktom52@gmail.com](mailto:thinktanktom52@gmail.com) or ping me on Telegram at [@thinktanktom](https://t.me/thinktanktom).

Thanks for stopping by! Now, go and conquer the digital world, just like I’m trying to do (with a bit of AI help, of course).

Cheers,
Thomas
