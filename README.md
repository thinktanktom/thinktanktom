# Hi there, I'm Thomas Cyriac! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I tinker with code, occasionally break things, and sometimes even fix them. I'm currently freelancing at Upwork, turning thoughts into code and ideas into reality.

### About Me

- **🎓 Education**: I graduated from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, where I juggled football, speedcubing, and the dream of one day assembling the ultimate desktop PC. It was a time of epic wins on the field, quick cube solves, and plotting the specs of a future dream machine—because what’s college without a few lofty ambitions and a lot of late-night coding?
- **🛠️ Skills**: I consider myself an engineer who can build just about anything. So far, I've dabbled in AI, DevOps, and Blockchain Technology—think of it as engineering on steroids.
- **💻 Setup**: Currently rocking a Dell XPS 15 9520 with NixOS 24.05. Because when you’re in the business of building and breaking things, you need a setup that’s as cutting-edge as your imagination.
- **🤖 Fun Fact**: This README is AI-generated—proof that even my documentation prefers to take the path of least resistance. I let the AI do the heavy lifting, so I can focus on making things awesome.

### Why "thinktanktom"?
Why "thinktanktom," you ask?  
"ThinkTankTom" isn’t just a random mashup of words; it’s a testament to my love for solving complex puzzles with a dash of creativity. Think of it as the place where big ideas meet practical solutions—kind of like a think tank, but with fewer suits and more code. And "Tom"? Well, that's just there to keep things friendly and to remind everyone that even the most serious problems deserve a bit of a personal touch.
